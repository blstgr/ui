h3. goal:

1. user must confirm dcv before we place order. 
cases when a user uploaded a file or added dns record but didn’t click “confirm” will result in forever in progress ssl, as sectigo will know nothing about this cert 
we either should allow the same actions on the ssl list as we do on ssl details or not allow any dcv actions in “my ssl” for a user to go through a full flow on details page.

2. it could be convenient for a user who has multiple ssl and does not need instructions to complete dcv from list instead of stepper

3. giving real time feedback in UI may decrease amount of cs requests “where is my certificate”, we should do it whenever possible

if we can’t release details and list for fast issuance at the same time or option 1 is too expensive, go for option 2
h4. improvement:

users who need to renew several ssl at a time complain that they can’t add to cart multiple ssl at a time. we used to have an "add to cart" animation, let’s return it. on "my ssl" page only for now
h3. to do:

1
 * enable dcv actions on ssl list (option 1)
 * remove dcv actions from the list (option 2)
 * update ssl list layout
 * whatever is selected by default will be assigned ssl after activation in details (active tab) and in list (dcv btn). system default is DNS

 

2
 * change add to cart behavior
 * break down reactivate and renew into 2 filters, remove “install”.

 

3

timer - _{color:#4c9aff}anna is in progess{color}_ - add timer to all type of certs
 * timer has unlimited cycles 
 * N cycles mean how many times "try again" btn is displayed
 * timer cycle length should be configurable for each validation type
 * once we placed order, ssl may get to issued state regardless of timer
 * ssl status can be updated when timer over (we check in DB) or on page refresh
 * if ssl is still not issued on page refresh AND cycle length is not over, timer continues 
 * timer is triggered by btn click that moves user to step with timer

* dv ssl must be issued close to instant. currently 50% of DNS validated ssl are issued within 1 min and 75% within 10


* time to get business validation ssl issued

css:

 * actions in "my ssl" - btn-s as is
 * cal - btn link
 * add input-s + input-group
 * update tooltip

update icons:
 * times bold
 * pause
 * details

 

6
create task to update header or update in scope of this task


h3. dod:

list
 * stepper and list must be in sync and show same things at any given time

 * "valid till" will be used instead of expires/pauses as a unified term.

 * suggest leaving “cal” btn when “valid till” date exists regardless of ssl is alive and this button makes sense or ssl is dead. if i missed expiration date “cal” btn may reinforce me to use this option next time and we won’t need to create extra logic.

 * user should be able to tell which dcv action in the list is done

 * user should be able to tell if dcv email is sent if they are sending it from the list - show confirmation notification on email send same as on details page

* textarea for emails in dynamic list should use autosize.js, maxheight: 80px or. 2rows

* all inputs and textarea for dcv values in dynamic list is read only


add to cart in list
 * once buy btn is clicked it’s not possible to click it again, as it’s not possible to buy 2 renewals

timer
* user should be able to get ssl as fast as possible, timer should not make user wait longer than usual
* we should be able to track the full funnel for ov/ev: dcv -> get ssl+timer -> issued even if user will not physically stay on the page and return in a few days/hours to download ssl 
* we should know how many timer cycles were needed to issue all ssl types
