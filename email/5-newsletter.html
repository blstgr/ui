            <h2>Hey buddy,</h2>
            <p>As you may have noticed, these are turbulent times. And it’s during turbulent times that it’s
                most
                important
                to stay grounded, positive, and focus on doing what we can control rather than what we can’t.
            </p>
            <p>While we can’t give you all the answers to some of the bigger issues facing everyone around the
                world
                right now, we’d like to offer you a helping hand when it comes to maintaining some normalcy.
                Part of
                that is making sure you’re as secure as can be now that it’s necessary to stay connected through
                the
                Internet rather than in-person interactions.
            </p>
            <p><a href="#toc">Our blog round-up for the month</a> features content on how to do just thatas well as
                several
                more
                pieces to keep you in the know about all things SSL.
            </p>

            <p>In the meantime online connections are more important than ever. Make sure you’re doing it
                safely.
