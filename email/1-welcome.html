            <h2>5. SSL renewal: time to start over
            </h2>

            <p>When it’s time to renew, you’ll need to go through the whole process again, ugh. It might seem like a
                pain, but it’s for your benefit. Honest.
                To minimize the chance of someone impersonating your site or stealing your private key, as well as
                ensuring that a company that received an SSL still exists, the lifespan of an SSL is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, when your SSL dies, your CA gives you a new one for the same domain. Before this happens, you will
                get an email from us alerting you that the time to renew is coming soon.
            </p>
            <p>You can also purchase a brand new cert from SSLs.com store and activate it for the same domain, but the
                benefit of buying from the renewal email is that the remaining days of your current SSL will be
                transferred to your new one. The earliest time to renew is 30 days before expiration. </p>

            <p>What does the renewal process look like, anyway? Familiar, probably… Count to 10, rinse and repeat:</p>
