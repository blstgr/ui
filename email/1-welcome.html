            <p>
                We have implemented an <a href="#">automatic way to create CSR and private key</a> in browser, so you
                don’t need to go back and
                forth to your hosting company and us and worry about creating all these files.

            </p>

                            Private key will be saved to your “Downloads” folder with
                            the name "site_com_key.zip". Don't loose it, or you will need to reisse SSL.

                    </div>

                </div>
                <p>


                    You can also use traditional way, and use CSR if you are already created one on your hosting server.
                    In
                    such a case, your private key will be on the server.

                <p>Once CA issues SSL for you, you’ll get an email from them with SSL file and <a

                </p>
                <p>
                    Take SSL file, CA bundle and PK that was saved in your “Downloads” folder or only SSL files and CA

                    to us
                    with your own CSR and upload those files to your server. There are very many varations of how you
                    can do that, all of them are

            <h2>6. Auto-renew?</h2>

            <p>Not yet, but.. We offer 3-, 4- year SSL, as a way to pay for several years in advance. Long-term
                relationships give you the benefit of having a better price per year, one less step during the renewal
                process, as you will only need to re-activate and re-install SSL after 2 years period for free.

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Whatever automatic renewal you are promissed, it's always semi-automatic, if there is no access to your
                server. As with each renewal, you get a new SSL every time that needs re-installaiton.</p>

        </div>


        <!-- 6 -->
        <div class="section" id="PCI">
            <h2>5. SSL renewal: start all over</h2>

            <p>When it’s time to renew, we’ll need to go thorugh the whole process again, ugh. In
                order to minimize the chance of someone hacking your site, stealing your private key and to make sure a
                company that received an SSL still exists, any SSL lives for a limited time.

            </p>
            <p>

                Thus, when your SSL dies, CA gives you a new one for the same domain. You can also purchase a brand new
                cert from SSLs.com store and activate it for the same domain, but the benefit of buying from renewal
                email is that the remaining days
                will be transferred to your new SSL. The earliest time to renew is 30 days before expiration. Count to
                10 and repeat:
