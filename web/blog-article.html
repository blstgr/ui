                                more vulnerable work-from-home environments, to their advantage. They’re ramping up the
                                size
                                and scope of attacks during this vulnerable time, targeting individuals, businesses, and

                            <h2>The four most common types of cyber attack</h2>
                            <p>According to a recent report by Interpol on the impact of Covid-19 on cyber crime, there
                                has
                                been an increase in cyber crime related to the following areas:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Online scams and phishing</li>
                                <li>The use of various types of malware</li>
                                <li>Malicious URLs</li>
                                <li>Misinformation</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Let’s take a closer look at each one and what they involve.</p>

                            <h2>Online scams and phishing
                            </h2>
                            <p>From the outset of the pandemic, there was a sharp increase in online scams and phishing
                                emails. Phishing involves cyber criminals sending convincing emails to a target while
                                posing
                                as a friend, business, or trusted organization, in an attempt to steal personal
                                information
                                or to trick the recipient into downloading malware, either by sending people to a fake
                                website or through email attachments. Coronavirus-related phishing scams seek to
                                capitalize
                                on people’s anxieties, offering things like non-existent vaccines and consumer relief
                                packages. </p>
                            <p>These kinds of attacks are happening across every sector. Back in April, the World Health
                                Organization reported that it had experienced five times the number of cyber attacks
                                than
                                the same period in 2019, with attacks directed at staff and the general public alike.
                                These
                                scammers even directed people to donate money to a fake version of WHO’s COVID-19
                                Solitary
                                Response Fund. </p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, UK Finance — an industry body that represents more than 250 financial-related
                                firms in the UK — have reported their top ten scams related to Coronavirus. Some of the
                                most
                                shocking include a fake contact tracing email claiming to be from the national health
                                service, council tax reductions, fake emails from online tv subscription services, and
                                even
                                fake online dating profiles.</p>
                            <p>As you can see, even top organizations are being used in these attacks. Avoid being
                                ensnared
                                by a phishing attack or an online scam by regarding any unsolicited email with
                                suspicion. If
                                something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Strange layouts, misspellings, and
                                inaccurate logos are usually a dead giveaway in these kinds of scams. Study the email
                                address the email has been sent from — it’s usually very different from the official
                                organization’s email. Search for the official site in Google and check if the same
                                things
                                are being offered there. If not, report it to the organization in question so they can
                                warn
                                subscribers or customers. </p>
                            <p>For more information on phishing and how to protect yourself, check out our blog post on
                                the
                                subject.</p>
                            <h2>Malware</h2>
                            <p>In the report, Interpol also reported an increase in the use of disruptive malware, like
                                DDoS
                                attacks and ransomware, and data harvesting malware. DDoS (distributed
                                denial-of-service)
                                attacks involve flooding a website or service with fake traffic so that it is
                                overwhelmed
                                and rendered unavailable. Ransomware encrypts user files so that they cannot be
                                accessed,
                                basically holding it hostage for a price. Meanwhile, data harvesting malware can steal
                                sensitive data from computers and even divert funds.</p>
                            <p>There are all sorts of methods for installing these types of malware on computers,
                                including
                                the aforementioned combination of phishing emails and scam websites. To protect
                                yourself,
                                never download anything from a website or source you aren’t 100% sure is the real deal.
                                Some
                                of these malware email scams even pretend to offer protection against these types of
                                scams,
                                so you really need to be careful. There have even been reports of such emails targeting
                                work-from-home environments as a means of gaining access to company networks. </p>
                            <p>Even if an email seems like it has your best interests at heart, you need to exercise
                                caution. In case you do accidentally download something suspicious, make sure you have
                                anti-virus software installed on your computer and that it’s kept up-to-date. </p>
